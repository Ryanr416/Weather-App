The Weather App



This is an app to give you detailed and accurate weather information based on the city you type into the search engine.
You are able to sign up for an account for a more personalized experience. 
You can also save cities to your account for easy access later.

You can see the screenshots of the app here :

In order to get started, you sign up for an account, type in your city, and your local weather details will appear. You can click Add to save a city, and Remove after youve added a city to remove it.


My future plans include A weather radar, as well as a more indepth details page.
